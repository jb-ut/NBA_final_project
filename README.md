# NBA_final_project - Technologies

## Focus

This branch of the project focuses on discussing techncologies for each process of the project and describing why that technology was chosen.

1. GitHub Repository -  This is a well known program introduced at the beginning of the class as the go to platform for IT project collaboration for multiple members of a project.  Different branches focusing on different steps within a project can be viewed and editied by all members of the project team.

2. Database Design - We used pgAdmin to manipluate the tables as this was a familiar tool after using it in our Module 7. Further, we wil subit a database diagram from quickdatabasediagrams.com to show the data layout and entity - relationships between the tables and their attributes.  Both of these tools were also familiar to us and provided a good workflow for the DB design.

3. Machine Learning - We will utilize a supervised machine learning model for ouyr project as this is the most straight forward way to obtain our results.  We used the Pandas and Jupyter Notebook to read in the data and create our dataframe as this program is the most familiar to us..  We then cleaned and massaged the data and performed exploratory anlysis using Python.

4. Visualization - We will be using Tableau as this is a simple snd straightforward program that can be used to dump information straight into Story books.

5. Dashboard - We will be using Story books as this is a simple program used to explain this history of the workflow.
