## Team members and roles
- John Brown - GitHub Repository/Visualizations
- Mia Greenberg - Database Design
- Taylor Coffee - Machine Learning Modeling
- Jeff Austin - Technologies/Dashboard

## Project Overview and Purpose
The entire team consists of sports enthusiasts and we wanted to chose a major sport where we could analyze data for our final project.  Specifically, we chose to conduct an analysis using NBA data to predict the following three topics:

- Home wins based on attendance
- Home wins based on Field Goal %
- Home wins based on fouls

## Resources
Data Sources searched to analyze and minipulate came from the website https://www.kaggle.com/wyattowalsh/basketball, which is a dataset that is updated daily and contains data on all games, all teams, and all players within the NBA including:

- 60,000+ games (every game since the first NBA season in 1946-47) including for the games in which the statistics were recorded:
Box scores, Game summaries, Officials, Inactive players, Linescores, Last face-off stats, Season series info, Game video availability

- 30 teams with information including:
General team details (stadium, head coach, general manager, social media links, etc), Franchise history information (name changes, location changes, etc)

- 4500 players with:
Basic draft data, Prior affiliations, Career statistics. Anatomical data (height & weight)
and more, with plans for expansion!

Software and applications utilized for this study included:

- Group GitHub repo
- Python 3.7.6
- SQL Alchemy
- Pandas
- SQL within pgAdmin
- Tableau


## Analysis and Workflow

# Machine Learning Model

Details - 

- Description of preliminary data preprocessing - Using sqlalchemy, a select statement will be used to pull data into a DataFrame where a JOIN on the team id's and team abbreviations will be brought in.  From there, the team abbreviations were run through LabelEncoder from sklearn.preprocessing.  Following that transformation, the entire dataset is run through StandardScaler.  A binary Home_W column was generated from the original WL_HOME column whereby if WL_Home = W, then Home_W = 1 or if WL_Home = L, Home_W = 0.
- Description of preliminary feature engineering and preliminary feature selection, including the decision-making process - We have created a correlation table using pandas.corr() on a dataframe of all of the preliminary data.  From there, anything with a Pearson Correlation Ceofficient of >.3 or <-.3 was used.
- Description of how data was split into training and testing sets - Data was split into training and testing sets via the use of sklearn.model_selection's train_test_split default test_size and train_size, .75 and .25 respectively.
- Explanation of model choice, including limitations and benefits - Given the binary nature of whether or not the home team won (1 = Win, 0 = Loss), we opted to use Logistic Regression.  Feeding the Logistic Regression Model the limited number of columns selected, we were able to get the model as high as 92% accuracy training on 100 iterations.
- The confusion matrix showed that the model is fairly evenly mislabeling home wins and losses.  See Figure: 'Confusion Matrix' below.

# Database

Deliverable 1: Entity-Relationship Diagram: The entity-relationship is one to many between the id in the Team table and the TEAM_ID_HOME in the Game table.

Deliverable 2:

- Database stores static data for use during the project
- Database interfaces with the project in some format (e.g., scraping updates the database)
- Includes at least two tables (or collections, if using MongoDB)
- Includes at least one join using the database language (not including any joins in Pandas)
- Includes at least one connection string (using SQLAlchemy or PyMongo)

## Results (Visualizations/Dashboard)

Deliverable 2:

- Storyboard on a Google Slide(s) - Bar charts from Tableau Dashboards.  https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/156rbFzQtR6N_mrGVzII4gpKUENtHjqFAMoQHAVrRbM0/edit#slide=id.ge68a6a7707_0_23

- Description of the tool(s) that will be used to create the final dashboard - This project utilized Tableau Dashboards which is a a sequence of visualizations that work together to convey information of the history and different milestones of the project.

- Description of interactive element(s) - Interactive elements allow us to hover over different figures to see the results within the chart that is being displayed.  All charts and figures within our dashboard are interactive to see results at the viewers discretion.

Deliverable 4:

Conclusions

- We were did not create a recipe for on court success.
- We learned that there are a core set of statistics, that isnâ€™t the final score that can allow a machine learning model to predict home wins.

Future Work

- See whether the model is applicable to past and future seasons.
- Would this model be applicable to games played without crowds?
- Test column set against international leagues 
- Use more player specific stats (i.e. shot distance, etc.)

What would we have done differently?

- Take additional time to look at trends in different sports
- Dig deeper into quantifying on-court analysis
